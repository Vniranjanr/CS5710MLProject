Project Title : Alzheimer’s prediction using machine learning

Abstract: There are multiple factors that affect the person who is diagnosed with the Alzheimer’s disease so scientists research is still at the beginning stages to understand the exact cause of the disease.Main warning signs of this disease is loss of memory and other cognitive impairments. Brain MRI can detect mild cognitive impairments which can potentially develop Alzheimer’s disease. In the laboratory radiologists analyze these high resolution MRI images for abnormalities however, this process is cumbersome and time consuming most importantly it is prone to human error. As per a recent survey 5-10 percent of biomedical images are overlooked by the pathologists. Machine learning methods in the medical industry made a huge impact to reduce human effort and at the same time with accurate results. The objective of our project is to predict Alzheimer’s disease using three types of ensemble classifiers.In our project we have used a longitudinal dataset i.e. clinical and socio-demographic parameters for training the model. Clinical parameters include CDR(Clinical Dementia Rating), eTIV(Estimated Total Intracra- nial Volume), MMSE(Mini Mental State Examination) and the non clinical parameters include age, gender and dominant hand. Since the dataset is limited and small, ensemble models are efficient methods to predict the results. We are implementing the bagging, boosting and voting classifiers.
